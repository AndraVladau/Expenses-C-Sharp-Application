# Expenses-C-Sharp-Application
The project is a C# application designed for efficient management of invoices and documents. The key entities include documents and invoices, where documents represent generic records with attributes like name and issue date, while invoices extend this to include due date, purchases, and category information. Purchases, recorded within invoices, capture details such as product, quantity, and price, with associations to respective invoices for tracking. Data is stored in text files, organized by comma-separated records with attributes on separate lines.

Design ensures data processing primarily at the service or repository level, with user interaction confined to an intuitive interface. Functionalities, such as displaying documents issued in certain year, listing invoices due in the current month, and identifying categories with the most expenses, enhance the application's utility and effectiveness. These features provide users with valuable insights into their document and invoice data, allowing for better organization and decision-making. Additionally, by dynamically retrieving information based on specific criteria, the application streamlines processes andimproves user productivity.
